## Robot Control
1. Open the power support for the Robomaster Board
2. Make sure robot is on the ground and its wheel are at around the middle of body.
3. Open the power support for the motors and IMU by using remote switch.
4. Wait for the calibration of IMU and motors enable (about 30 seconds)
5. Then you can use DJI RC to control robot according to the following figure (the first step is to increae the body height)

Attention: Currently, hardware is not stable enough, if the robot is shaking heavily or lose control, you can just lower body to the ground or shut down the power by remote switch
